# 03: Data product-centered architectures

## Description
In this chapter will analyze the principles that underpin a data product-centered architecture and its main components. 
Recognizing that a data management solution is a complex socio-technological system, we'll seamlessly blend our analysis of organizational architecture with that of technological architecture. 
Finally, we'll showcase alternative approaches to modern data management and examine how they architecturally align with the data-centric product management approach.
