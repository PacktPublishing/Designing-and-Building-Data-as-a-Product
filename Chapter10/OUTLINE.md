# 10 - Distributed data modeling

## Description
In this chapter, we will examine data modeling within a modular, decentralized architecture centered on data products. We’ll start by clarifying what a data model entails and why intentionality in modeling is crucial. Then, we’ll explore various physical modeling techniques, assessing their strengths and how they fit into a distributed landscape. Finally, we’ll discuss conceptual data modeling, emphasizing its role in crafting high-level abstractions that guide the design and evolution of data products in a cohesive ecosystem
