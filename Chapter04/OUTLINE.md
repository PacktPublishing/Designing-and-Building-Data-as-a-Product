# 01 - From data as a by-product to data as a product

## Description
In this chapter, we will see how to identify data products and prioritize their development following a use case-driven
approach. Initially, we'll introduce techniques to segment the organization into business domains,
sub-domains and bounded contexts. Subsequently, we'll examine how to identify business cases
within these domains and those that cut across them. Finally, we'll address the identification of
essential data products to support these business cases. We'll discuss agile methods for justifying
their development and explore portfolio strategies for prioritizing them.
