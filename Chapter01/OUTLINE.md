# 01 - From data as a by-product to data as a product

## Description
We will see how the latest traditional data management architectures (Data Warehouse, Data Lake, Data Lakehouse, and Modern Data Stack), beyond the obvious differences, share a strongly centralized management approach that inevitably results in producing monolithic platforms. 

We will then see how these monolithic platforms are doomed to consistently generate the same issues of maintainability and scalability, making them unsustainable over time. 

Finally, we will introduce the concept of modular data architectures based on the principle of treating data as a product. We'll demonstrate how platforms of this kind, built through the composition of independent but interoperable data products, can solve the problems generated by traditional monolithic architectures. 

## Intro
In this book, we will explore how to transition from managing data merely as a by-product that supports applications to managing data as a product in its own right. Before tackling the various aspects contributing to this paradigm shift, it's crucial to first understand why managing data as a product is important and how this practice enables us to surpass the limits of today's data platforms 

In this chapter, we will explore the history of monolithic data platforms that have characterized the evolution of data management over the last 30 years. We will seek to understand the common problems that make them incapable of sustainably managing the accidental complexity they generate as they grow. Finally, we will see why addressing the fundamental issues, instead of merely treating surface-level symptoms, requires more than just technological innovations. It calls for a paradigm shift that leads us towards more sustainable socio-technical architectures, based on the key practice of managing data as a product. 

## Summary
There is no doubt about the importance that data holds for organizations today in order to compete in the market. However, the ways in which we traditionally manage data have led to the construction of monolithic platforms unable to survive the complexity they themselves generate. 

Technological innovations have helped us solve many problems related to data management over time, but not the root causes of these problems. With each new generation of data platforms, the same issues have always resurfaced.  

In this chapter, we have seen how a paradigm shift in data management is necessary to make our platforms sustainable over time. A paradigm shift centered around the idea of treating data as a product and building modular platforms capable of governing the intrinsic complexity they generate without collapsing. It is a systemic transformation that touches on different levels of the organization. We have shown in the previous sections  the desired transformation required for each level, from mental models to operating practices.  

In the rest of the book, we will explore through which leverage points we can intervene on the organization to promote the paradigm shift we have described here. The ultimate goal is to bring about a qualitative leap in the entire organization, allowing us to build data platforms capable of producing sustainable value over time. In other words, transitioning from the development of data platforms that follow a growth and kill dynamic to platforms that follow an adapt and evolve dynamic. 

We embark on this journey by starting to analyze in the next chapter what exactly a data product is, what its components and key characteristics are.

## Skills learned
* SKILL 1: Understand the systemic elements (negative reinforcement loops between cognitive load, tech debt, and maintenance costs) that make monolithic data platforms challenging to scale and evolve over time 
* SKILL 2: Understand what it means to treat data as a product and how this approach enables the construction of modular platforms that address the systemic issues of traditional monolithic architectures. 
* SKILL 3: Understand what a data product is (definition and key pillars)  
* SKILL 4:  Understand  what characteristics a data product must possess to generate value over time for the organization (e.g. Discoverability and addressability, Understandability and composability, trustability and security, etc.)
