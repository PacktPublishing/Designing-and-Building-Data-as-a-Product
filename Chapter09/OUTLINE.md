# 09 - Team topologies and data ownership at scale 

## Description
In this chapter, we will explore how to design an optimal organizational structure to implement the socio-technical architecture of a data management function aiming to transition to managing data as a product.
We will first introduce the Team Topologies framework and its four types of teams and three interaction modes. 
Then, we will examine how to organize operational and management teams and their interaction modes based on the organization's context and goals to achieve a rapid flow of data product-driven value delivery. 
Finally, we will look at how to integrate these teams within the organizational structure, considering when and how to adopt either more centralized or decentralized data management models.
