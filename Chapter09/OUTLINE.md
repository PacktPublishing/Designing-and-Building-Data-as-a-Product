# 09 - Team topologies and data ownership at scale 

## Description
We'll examine different possible operational models that underpin a data product-centered architecture. We'll start by exploring distinct workstreams, such as those tied to data product development, architecture governance, and platform development. We'll then analyze how these workstreams can be allocated across teams, with varying emphasis on decentralization depending on the context and adoption stage. Lastly, we'll delve into key roles, their responsibilities, and how they interact within the different operational models described.
