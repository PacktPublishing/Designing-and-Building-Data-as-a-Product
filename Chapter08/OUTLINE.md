# 08 - Moving through the adoption journey 

## Description
We'll see how to successfully move through the adoption journey of the data-as-a-product
paradigm.
We will first analyze how a new paradigm spreads within an organization by introducing the main
phases of the adoption journey. Next, we'll delve deeper into each phase, exploring its objectives,
the unique challenges it presents, and the critical organizational and operational activities required
at each step. Finally, we will see how to define a data strategy that can evolve agilely in the different 
phases of the adoption journey, adapting to the needs of each of them, making full use of what has
been learned in the previous phases.

## Skills learned
* **SKILL 1**: Grasping how to structure the assessment phase, paying particular attention to the
stakeholders to engage, the activities to undertake, and the deliverables to generate
* **SKILL 2**: Understand how to start by choosing key platform capabilities in the boostrap phase
and initiating the first data products , maximizing organizational buy-in for the subsequent
scaling.
* **SKILL 3**: Understand how to scale the adoption beyond the boostrap phase incrementally
onboard the whole organization
* **SKILL 4**: The ability to define, monitor, and evolve key elements of the strategy throughout
all the stages of the adoption journey.
