# 01 - From data as a by-product to data as a product

## Description
In this chapter, we will explore what exactly a data product is, defining the concepts of data product, pure data product, and analytical application. 
Next, we'll outline the four key characteristics that every data product should possess to maximize the value of the data assets it manage. We’ll also explore the main components that contribute to forming a data product, ensuring its modularity from both a structural and managerial perspective.
Finally, we will examine some commonly adopted methods for classifying data products.
