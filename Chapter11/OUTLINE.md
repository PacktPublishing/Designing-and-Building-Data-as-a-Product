# 11 - Building an AI-Ready Information Architecture 

## Description
In this chapter, we will see how to build an entire information architecture that maximizes the potential value of the managed data assets, starting from the developed data products. 
We will begin by examining the layers that make up the information architecture and how each layer enriches the managed data with contextual information that helps to better understand its meaning and possible uses within a specific domain. 
We will then focus on the knowledge plane, which is the level within the information architecture where data is described using interconnected conceptual models shared across the organization to ensure semantic interoperability between data products. 
Finally, we'll explore how federated modeling teams can define knowledge models incrementally based on business needs and connect them to physical data, forming an enterprise knowledge graph that is essential for unlocking the full potential of modern generative AI.
