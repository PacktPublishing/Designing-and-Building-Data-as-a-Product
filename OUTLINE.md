# SECTION ONE: Data as a product

## Description  
We'll delve into the rationale behind and the implications of treating data as a product. We'll meticulously examine the various components constituting a data product, beginning with the interfaces accessible to external consumers, navigating through internal data management applications, and culminating in the infrastructure essential for operating it in production. Ultimately, we'll showcase the characteristics and capabilities that a data architecture centered on data products must embody to strike a balance between the agility required for scalability and the governance necessary for sustainability.

# SECTION TWO: Data product lifecycle

# SECTION TWO: Data product strategy

## Description
We will explore how to manage a data product throughout its lifecycle. We'll begin by examining
how to identify the data products to develop, prioritize them using a use-case-driven approach, and
model them based on requirements. We will then look at how to handle releases and data product
management in a production environment by adapting common DevOps practices to the data
context. Finally, we will explore how to automate lifecycle management through a self-serve
platform analyzing its core capabilities, architecture, and implementation options (make vs. buy).
