# SECTION ONE: Data products and the power of modular architectures 
We'll delve into the rationale behind and the implications of treating data as a product. We'll meticulously examine the various components constituting a data product, beginning with the interfaces accessible to external consumers, navigating through internal data management applications, and culminating in the infrastructure essential for operating it in production. Ultimately, we'll showcase the characteristics and capabilities that a data architecture centered on data products must have to strike a balance between the agility required for scalability and the governance necessary for sustainability.

# SECTION TWO: How to manage the data product lifecycle
We will explore how to manage a data product throughout its lifecycle. We'll begin by examining
how to identify the data products to develop, prioritize them using a business-case-driven approach, and
model them based on requirements. We will then look at how to handle releases and data product
management in a production environment by adapting common DevOps practices to the data
context. Finally, we will explore how to automate lifecycle management through a self-serve
platform analyzing its core capabilities, architecture, and implementation options (make vs. buy).

# SECTION THREE: How to define and execute a successful data product strategy

We will explore how to design and implement an incremental, value-driven strategy for successfully
adopting architectures centered on data products. We'll analyze key elements of the strategy and
how to define them in the early stages of the adoption journey. Understanding how to kickstart the
initiative and secure buy-in from key stakeholders will be covered. Subsequently, we'll examine how
to scale adoption across the enterprise by fostering a data-driven culture based on the principle of
managing data as a product. Finally, we'll delve into data modeling in a distributed environment,
emphasizing how modeling, both at the physical and conceptual levels, is a crucial element for fully
leveraging the potential offered by modern generative AI solutions.
