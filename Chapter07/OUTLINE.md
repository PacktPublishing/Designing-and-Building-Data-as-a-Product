# 07 - Automating data product’s lifecycle management

## Description
We'll explore how to accelerate scaling in the adoption of a data product-centric approach to data
management by establishing a XOps platform that supports the whole data ecosystem. We'll start
by examining its core capabilities and underlying architecture.
Then, we'll explore how XOps Platform leverages its capabilities to provide a streamlined and unified
experience to all actors in the ecosystem, boosting developer, operation and consumer experience.
Finally, we'll explore XOps Platform implementation, outlining key principles to guide the critical
decision between building (make), purchasing (buy), or adopting a hybrid approach.
