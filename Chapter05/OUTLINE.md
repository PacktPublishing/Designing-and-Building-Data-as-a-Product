# 05 - Designing and implementing data products

## Description
In this chapter, we will explore the process of designing a data product based on the requirements identified during
the analysis phase. Our journey will begin by delving into advanced techniques for defining scope,
interfaces, and the relationships with the external ecosystem. We'll then dissect the core
components of a data product, outlining their development process and showing how to describe
them through machine-readable descriptor document. Lastly, we'll embark on a journey through
the data flow within a data product, examining components responsible for sourcing, processing,
and serving data.

## Skills learned
* **SKILL 1**: Ability to accurately define the scope of a data product and accordingly design the
relationship with external ecosystem through context mapping
* **SKILL 2**: Ability to manage the discovery, interpretation, and acquisition of data used by the
data product, sourced from both other data products and external application systems.
* **SKILL 3**: Skill in crafting internal data transformations while striking the optimal balance
between development autonomy and streamlining the technological stack.
* **SKILL 4**: Expertise in determining the optimal data serving methods for generated data to
enhance its accessibility and reuse across various use cases.
* **SKILL 5**: Understanding how to formally describe the designed data product to ease its
utilization by potential consumers and to facilitate the automation of its life cycle.
